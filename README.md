The open-source hardware heart monitor project
----------------------------------------------

* 2014-03-25:DAV: first public posting.

* safe
* make visible some of the normally-hidden workings of the human heart
* open source hardware

The various electronic subsystems can be arranged to build:

* Open source Holter monitor:
able to scale down to a standard 4 electrode Holter monitor.
Comfortable -- lightweight even including the batteries.
Long run-time.
etc.
* Open source body surface potential mapping:
able to scale up to record from dozens of electrodes simultaneously.
(The so-called "12-lead EKG" has 10 electrodes.)

Body surface potential mapping
is the original motivation for the openheart project.

DAV and Dr.K wanted some body surface potential mapping data
in order to test out some theories
and heuristics and ideas we had
for approximate solutions to
the inverse electrocardiography problem.
Off-the-shelf devices for recording body surface potential data were
beyond DAV's budget at the time,
but DAV's experience with
mixed microcontrollers and data acquisition
made him think it that one could be built for a more reasonable price.

The inverse electrocardiography problem
is the problem of making a 3D picture of the electrical activity of the heart,
when all we have is the body surface potential data.

DAV is buying the first prototype PCBs from OSHPark
(Open Source Holter (OSH), OSHPark -- see the connection?)

We thought about using 
the acronym IEKG -- Improved Electrocardiogram --
but
the "Institut für Ethik und Kommunikation im Gesundheitswesen"
(the institute for ethics and communication in health care)
already used the acronym IEKG.

Still looking for a catchy acronym.
